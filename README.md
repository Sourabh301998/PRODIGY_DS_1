# Population Visualization using Bar Chart and Histogram

This project demonstrates how to visualize **categorical** and **continuous** variables using bar charts and histograms in Python. It is part of a data science learning exercise.

## File

- `PRODIGY_DS_1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code to:
  - Visualize gender distribution using a bar chart
  - Visualize age distribution using a histogram
  - Use sample data in the absence of age/gender details in the original dataset

## Visualizations

1. Bar Chart: Represents gender distribution (`Male` vs `Female`) using sample data.
2. Histogram: Represents age distribution using randomly generated age values.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or run locally in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute each cell step-by-step.
3. Optionally, replace the sample data with real-world data for custom analysis.

## Note

The original World Bank dataset (`API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_81108.zip`) contains total population per country and year, but **not** individual-level age or gender data. Therefore, sample data was used for educational purposes.
